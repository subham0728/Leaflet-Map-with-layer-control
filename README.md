# Leaflet-Map-with-layer-control
This is a simple interactive map using Leaflet.js.  
It includes OpenStreetMap and Esri Satellite views.  
Users can switch between the two map layers.  
The map is centered on a default location with zoom controls.  
Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.  
No external libraries other than Leaflet are used.  
Great starter project for learning web mapping.
